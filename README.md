# ASCII-Art-Generator
This program reads an image, calculates the average color of its pixels, and prints it as characters in the console.
> [!NOTE]
> To use the program, paste the path to your image file (jpg, png, etc.).<br>
> You can customize which characters are used and how many pixels get converted into each character.

> 1. Requires .NET 9.0.
> 2. Windows only at the moment (uses System.Drawing).

## Have fun! 🎨
Turn your images into ASCII art and bring your console to life!<br>
Feel free to tweak the characters, experiment with pixel density, and create something unique.<br>
**Happy drawing! ✨**
